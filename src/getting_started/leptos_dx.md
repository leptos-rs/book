# Leptos Developer Experience Improvements


There are a couple of things you can do to improve your experience of developing websites and apps with Leptos. You may want to take a few minutes and set up your environment to optimize your development experience, especially if you want to code along with the examples in this book.

## 1) Editor Autocompletion inside `#[component]` and `#[server]`

Because of the nature of macros (they can expand from anything to anything, but only if the input is exactly correct at that instant) it can be hard for rust-analyzer to do proper autocompletion and other support.


If you run into issues using these macros in your editor, you can explicitly tell rust-analyzer to ignore certain proc macros. For the `#[server]` macro especially, which annotates function bodies but doesn't actually transform anything inside the body of your function, this can be really helpful.

Starting in Leptos version 0.5.3, rust-analyzer support was added for the `#[component]` macro, but if you run into issues, you may want to add `#[component]` to the macro ignore list as well (see below).
Note that this means that rust-analyzer doesn't know about your component props, which may generate its own set of errors or warnings in the IDE.

VSCode `settings.json`:

```json
"rust-analyzer.procMacro.ignored": {
	"leptos_macro": [
        // optional:
		// "component",
		"server"
	],
}
```

neovim with lspconfig:

```lua
require('lspconfig').rust_analyzer.setup {
  -- Other Configs ...
  settings = {
    ["rust-analyzer"] = {
      -- Other Settings ...
      procMacro = {
        ignored = {
            leptos_macro = {
                -- optional: --
                -- "component",
                "server",
            },
        },
      },
    },
  }
}
```

Helix, in `.helix/languages.toml`:

```toml
[[language]]
name = "rust"

[language-server.rust-analyzer]
config = { procMacro = { ignored =
    { leptos_macro =
        [
          # Optional:
          # "component",
          "server"
        ] } } }
```

```admonish info
The Jetbrains `intellij-rust` plugin (RustRover as well) currently does not support dynamic config for macro exclusion.
However, the project currently maintains a hardcoded list of excluded macros.
As soon as [this open PR](https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/10873) is merged, the `component` and
`server` macro will be excluded automatically without additional configuration needed.

Update (2023/10/02):
The `intellij-rust` plugin got deprecated in favor of RustRover at the same time the PR was opened, but an official
support request was made to integrate the contents of this PR.
```

## 2) Set up `leptosfmt` With Rust Analyzer (optional)

"leptosfmt" is a formatter for the Leptos `view!` macro (inside of which you'll typically write your UI code). Because the view! macro enables an 'RSX' (like JSX) style of writing your UI's, cargo-fmt has a harder time auto-formatting your code that's inside the view! macro. leptosfmt is a crate that solves your formattting issues and keeps your RSX-style UI code looking nice and tidy!

leptosfmt can be installed and used via the commandline or from within your code editor:

First, install the tool with `cargo install leptosfmt`.

If you just want to use the default options from the command line, just run `leptosfmt ./**/*.rs` from the root of your project to format all the rust files using leptosfmt.

If you wish to set up your editor to work with leptosfmt, or if you wish to customize your leptosfmt experience, please see the instructions available on the [leptosfmt github repo's README.md page](https://github.com/bram209/leptosfmt).

Just note that it's recommended to set up your editor with `leptosfmt` on a per-workspace basis for best results.
