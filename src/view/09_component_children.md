# Component Children

It’s pretty common to want to pass children into a component, just as you can pass
children into an HTML element. For example, imagine I have a `<FancyForm/>` component
that enhances an HTML `<form>`. I need some way to pass all its inputs.

```rust
view! {
    <FancyForm>
        <fieldset>
            <label>
                "Some Input"
                <input type="text" name="something"/>
            </label>
        </fieldset>
        <button>"Submit"</button>
    </FancyForm>
}
```

How can you do this in Leptos? There are basically two ways to pass components to
other components:

1. **render props**: properties that are functions that return a view
2. the **`children`** prop: a special component property that includes anything
   you pass as a child to the component.

In fact, you’ve already seen these both in action in the [`<Show/>`](/view/06_control_flow.html#show) component:

```rust
view! {
  <Show
    // `when` is a normal prop
    when=move || value.get() > 5
    // `fallback` is a "render prop": a function that returns a view
    fallback=|| view! { <Small/> }
  >
    // `<Big/>` (and anything else here)
    // will be given to the `children` prop
    <Big/>
  </Show>
}
```

Let’s define a component that takes some children and a render prop.

```rust
/// Displays a `render_prop` and some children within markup.
#[component]
pub fn TakesChildren<F, IV>(
    /// Takes a function (type F) that returns anything that can be
    /// converted into a View (type IV)
    render_prop: F,
    /// `children` can take one of several different types, each of which 
    /// is a function that returns some view type
    children: Children,
) -> impl IntoView
where
    F: Fn() -> IV,
    IV: IntoView,
{
    view! {
        <h1><code>"<TakesChildren/>"</code></h1>
        <h2>"Render Prop"</h2>
        {render_prop()}
        <hr/>
        <h2>"Children"</h2>
        {children()}
    }
}
```

`render_prop` and `children` are both functions, so we can call them to generate
the appropriate views. `children`, in particular, is an alias for
`Box<dyn FnOnce() -> AnyView>`. (Aren't you glad we named it `Children` instead?)
The `AnyView` returned here is an opaque, type-erased view: you can’t do anything to 
inspect it. There are a variety of other child types: for example, `ChildrenFragment` 
will return a `Fragment`, which is a collection whose children can be iterated over.

> If you need a `Fn` or `FnMut` here because you need to call `children` more than once,
> we also provide `ChildrenFn` and `ChildrenMut` aliases.

We can use the component like this:

```rust
view! {
    <TakesChildren render_prop=|| view! { <p>"Hi, there!"</p> }>
        // these get passed to `children`
        "Some text"
        <span>"A span"</span>
    </TakesChildren>
}
```

## Manipulating Children

The [`Fragment`](https://docs.rs/leptos/latest/leptos/struct.Fragment.html) type is
basically a way of wrapping a `Vec<AnyView>`. You can insert it anywhere into your view.

But you can also access those inner views directly to manipulate them. For example, here’s
a component that takes its children and turns them into an unordered list.

```rust
/// Wraps each child in an `<li>` and embeds them in a `<ul>`.
#[component]
pub fn WrapsChildren(children: ChildrenFragment) -> impl IntoView {
    // children() returns a `Fragment`, which has a
    // `nodes` field that contains a Vec<View>
    // this means we can iterate over the children
    // to create something new!
    let children = children()
        .nodes
        .into_iter()
        .map(|child| view! { <li>{child}</li> })
        .collect::<Vec<_>>();

    view! {
        <h1><code>"<WrapsChildren/>"</code></h1>
        // wrap our wrapped children in a UL
        <ul>{children}</ul>
    }
}
```

Calling it like this will create a list:

```rust
view! {
    <WrapsChildren>
        "A"
        "B"
        "C"
    </WrapsChildren>
}
```

// Often, you want to pass some kind of child view to another

// - "render props": creating a component prop that takes a function

//   passed as the children of a component in your view, not as a
//   property
