# Deploying a Client-Side-Rendered App

If you’ve been building an app that only uses client-side rendering, working with Trunk as a dev server and build tool, the process is quite easy.

```bash
trunk build --release
```

`trunk build` will create a number of build artifacts in a `dist/` directory. Publishing `dist` somewhere online should be all you need to deploy your app. This should work very similarly to deploying any JavaScript application.

We've created several example repositories which show how to set up and deploy a Leptos CSR app to various hosting services.

_Note: Leptos does not endorse the use of any particular hosting service - feel free to use any service that supports static site deploys._

Examples:

- [Github Pages](#github-pages)
- [Vercel](#vercel)
- [Spin (serverless WebAssembly)](#spin---serverless-webassembly)
- [Netlify](#netlify)

## Github Pages

Deploying a Leptos CSR app to Github pages is a simple affair. First, go to your Github repo's settings and click on "Pages" in the left side menu. In the "Build and deployment" section of the page, change the "source" to "Github Actions". Then copy the following into a file such as `.github/workflows/gh-pages-deploy.yml`

```admonish example collapsible=true

    name: Release to Github Pages

    on:
      push:
        branches: [main]
      workflow_dispatch:

    permissions:
      contents: write # for committing to gh-pages branch.
      pages: write
      id-token: write

    # Allow only one concurrent deployment, skipping runs queued between the run in-progress and latest queued.
    # However, do NOT cancel in-progress runs as we want to allow these production deployments to complete.
    concurrency:
      group: "pages"
      cancel-in-progress: false

            # relatively as favicon.ico. if we skip public-url option, the href paths will instead request username.github.io/favicon.ico which
            # will obviously return error 404 not found.

## Vercel

### Step 1: Set Up Vercel

In the Vercel Web UI...

1. Create a new project
2. Ensure
   - The "Build Command" is left empty with Override on
   - The "Output Directory" is changed to dist (which is the default output directory for Trunk builds) and the Override is on

<img src="./image.png" />

### Step 2: Add Vercel Credentials for GitHub Actions

Note: Both the preview and deploy actions will need your Vercel credentials setup in GitHub secrets

1. Retrieve your [Vercel Access Token](https://vercel.com/guides/how-do-i-use-a-vercel-api-access-token) by going to "Account Settings" > "Tokens" and creating a new token - save the token to use in sub-step 5, below.

2. Install the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/cli) using the `npm i -g vercel` command, then run `vercel login` to login to your acccount.

3. Inside your folder, run `vercel link` to create a new Vercel project; in the CLI, you will be asked to 'Link to an existing project?' - answer yes, then enter the name you created in step 1. A new `.vercel` folder will be created for you.

4. Inside the generated `.vercel` folder, open the the `project.json` file and save the "projectId" and "orgId" for the next step.

5. Inside GitHub, go the repo's "Settings" > "Secrets and Variables" > "Actions" and add the following as [Repository secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets):
   - save your Vercel Access Token (from sub-step 1) as the `VERCEL_TOKEN` secret
   - from the `.vercel/project.json` add "projectID" as `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`
   - from the `.vercel/project.json` add "orgId" as `VERCEL_ORG_ID`

<i>For full instructions see ["How can I use Github Actions with Vercel"](https://vercel.com/guides/how-can-i-use-github-actions-with-vercel)</i>

### Step 3: Add Github Action Scripts

Finally, you're ready to simply copy and paste the two files - one for deployment, one for PR previews - from below or from [the example repo's `.github/workflows/` folder](https://github.com/diversable/vercel-leptos-CSR-deployment/tree/leptos_0.6/.github/workflows) into your own github workflows folder - then, on your next commit or PR deploys will occur automatically.

## Spin - Serverless WebAssembly

Another option is using a serverless platform such as Spin. Although [Spin](https://github.com/fermyon/spin) is open source and you can run it on your own infrastructure (eg. inside Kubernetes), the easiest way to get started with Spin in production is to use the Fermyon Cloud.

Start by installing the [Spin CLI using the instructions, here](https://developer.fermyon.com/spin/v2/install), and creating a Github repo for your Leptos CSR project, if you haven't done so already.

1. Open "Fermyon Cloud" > "User Settings". If you’re not logged in, choose the Login With GitHub button.

2. In the “Personal Access Tokens”, choose “Add a Token”. Enter the name “gh_actions” and click “Create Token”.

3. Fermyon Cloud displays the token; click the copy button to copy it to your clipboard.

4. Go into your Github repo and open "Settings" > "Secrets and Variables" > "Actions" and add the Fermyon cloud token to "Repository secrets" using the variable name "FERMYON_CLOUD_TOKEN"

5. Copy and paste the following Github Actions scripts (below) into your `.github/workflows/<SCRIPT_NAME>.yml` files

6. With the 'preview' and 'deploy' scripts active, Github Actions will now generate previews on pull requests & deploy automatically on updates to your 'main' branch.

# Netlify

All it takes to deploy a Leptos CSR app to Netlify is to create a project and to
add two simple configuration files in your project root. Let's begin with the
latter.

## Configuration Files

Create a `netlify.toml` file in your project root with the following content:

```toml
[build]
command = "rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown && cargo install trunk --locked && trunk build --release"
publish = "dist"

[build.environment]
RUST_VERSION = "stable"

[[redirects]]
from = "/*"
to = "/index.html"
status = 200
```

Create a `rust-toolchain.toml` file in your project root with the following
content:

```toml
[toolchain]
channel = "stable"
targets = ["wasm32-unknown-unknown"]
```

## Deployment

1. [Add your project to Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/start/add-new-project/)
   by connecting your Git repository
2. Netlify will automatically detect your `netlify.toml` configuration
3. If you need additional environment variables, configure them in
   [Netlify's environment variables settings](https://docs.netlify.com/build/environment-variables/overview/)

The `rust-toolchain.toml` ensures the correct Rust toolchain and WASM target are
available during the build process. The redirect rule in `netlify.toml` ensures
your SPA routes work correctly by serving `index.html` for all paths.
