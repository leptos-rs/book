This project contains the core of a new introductory guide to Leptos.

It is built using `mdbook`. You can view a local copy by installing `mdbook`

```sh
cargo install mdbook
```

This book also uses an mdbook preprocessor called `mdbook-admonish` to style blocks of text like notes, warnings, etc.

Install mdbook admonish using:

```sh
cargo install mdbook-admonish
```

and then run the book with
```sh
mdbook serve
```

It should be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
